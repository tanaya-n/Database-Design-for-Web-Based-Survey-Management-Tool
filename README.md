# Database-Design-for-web-based-survey-management-tool
Developed database design for a web-based survey management tool. This tool would help the faculty members and PhD students in the Computer Information Systems department of the school to conduct survey research. We went through the entire database development process from entity relationship modeling to normalization, creating schemas, relations, and finally queries.
